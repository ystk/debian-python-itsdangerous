Package: python-itsdangerous
Architecture: all
Depends: python (>= 2.7) | python-simplejson, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Various helpers to pass trusted data to untrusted environment - python 2.x
 itsdangerous provides a module that is a port of the django signing
 module.  It's not directly copied but some changes were applied to
 make it work better on its own.
 .
 itsdangerous allows web applications to use a key only it knows to
 cryptographically sign data and hand it over to someone else (e.g. a
 user).  When it gets the data back it can easily ensure that nobody
 tampered with it.
